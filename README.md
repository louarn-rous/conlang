## Phonology

### Consonants
| -            | Labial  | Alveolar  | Postalveolar | Palatal | Velar | Glottal |
|:-----------  |:-----:  |:-------:  |:-------:  |:---:  |:-----:  |:-:  |
| Nasal        | /m/     | /n/       |           |       |         |     |
| Plosive      | /p/ /b/ | /t/ /d/   |           |       | /k/ /ɡ/ |     |
| Affricate    |         | /t͡s/ /d͡z/ | /t͡ʃ/ /d͡ʒ/ |       |         |     |
| Fricative    | /f/ /v/ | /s/ /z/   | /ʃ/ /ʒ/   | /ʝ~j/ | /x/     | /h/ |
| Tap/Flap     |         | /ɾ/       |           |       |         |     |
| Lat. Approx. |         | /l/       |           |       |         |     |

if ⟨h⟩ precedes a vowel, and does not follow a consonant, it is realised as /h/.    
if it precedes a vowel, and follows a consonant, that consonant becomes aspirated.  
if it precedes a plosive, or if it follows a vowel but is followed by a consonant, it is realised as /x/.  
if it closes a front-vowel syllable at the end of a word, it is realised as \[ç].  


### Vowels  
| -     | Front   | Back |
| :-:   |   :-:   | :-:  |
| Close | /i/ /y/ | /u/  |
| Mid   | /e/ /ø/ | /o/  |
| Open  | /æ/     | /ɑ/  |

### Digraphs
| -          | -          |  -         |  -        |
|:---:       |:---:       |:---:       |:---:      |
|⟨dz⟩ → \[d͡z]|⟨lj⟩ → \[ʎ] |⟨ng⟩ → \[ŋ]|⟨tj⟩ → \[c]|
|⟨dž⟩ → \[d͡ʒ]|⟨hj⟩ → \[ç] |⟨nj⟩ → \[ɲ]|⟨dj⟩ → \[ɟ]|

### Phonotactics

Stress is always on the first syllable.

Syllable structure is (C)(H)V(C)(C).

In an conset (C)(H):
- (t) can be followed by (s), (š), (r), or (j)
- (d) can be followed by (z), (ž), (r), or (j)
- (p), (b), (k), (g), (f), and (v) can be followed by (r), (l), or (j)
- (s) and (š) can be followed by (t), (p), (k), (m), (n), (l), or (j)
- (z), (ž), (l), (m), and (n) can be followed by (j)
- (r), (h), (j) cannot be followed by any medial

if ⟨si⟩ is the body of a first syllable, it is realised as \[çi].  

⟨er⟩ is oft realised as \[ɪɾ].  

if ⟨ž⟩ is followed by a front vowel, it is closer to \[ʑ].  
if ⟨š⟩ is followed by a front vowel, it is closer to \[ɕ].


**Assimilation**

In consonant clusters terminated by an obstruent, all change their voicing according to the first.  
Prograde/progressive voicing assimilation occurs, even across word boundaries.

| t/d      | p/b      | k/g      |
| :-:      | :-:      | :-:      |
| ⟨tv⟩ → tf | ⟨pv⟩ → pf | ⟨kv⟩ → kf |
| ⟨tz⟩ → ts | ⟨pz⟩ → ps | ⟨kz⟩ → ks |
| ⟨tž⟩ → tš | ⟨pž⟩ → pš | ⟨kž⟩ → kš |
| ⟨df⟩ → dv | ⟨bf⟩ → bv | ⟨gf⟩ → gv |
| ⟨ds⟩ → dz | ⟨bs⟩ → bz | ⟨gs⟩ → gz |
| ⟨dš⟩ → dž | ⟨bš⟩ → bž | ⟨gš⟩ → gž |
| ⟨fd⟩ → ft | ⟨fb⟩ → fp | ⟨fg⟩ → fk |
| ⟨sd⟩ → st | ⟨sb⟩ → sp | ⟨sg⟩ → sk |
| ⟨šd⟩ → št | ⟨šb⟩ → šp | ⟨šg⟩ → šk |
| ⟨vt⟩ → vd | ⟨vp⟩ → vb | ⟨vk⟩ → vg | 
| ⟨zt⟩ → zd | ⟨zp⟩ → zb | ⟨zk⟩ → zg |
| ⟨žt⟩ → žd | ⟨žp⟩ → žb | ⟨žk⟩ → žg |

| s/z      | š/ž      |
| :-:      | :-:      |
| ⟨sv⟩ → sf | ⟨šv⟩ → šf |
| ⟨zf⟩ → zv | ⟨žf⟩ → žv |

## Verbs

Verbs are conjugated by appending the desired tense's suffixal to the verb's stem.  
When the action of the verb is described as a potential without being in a specific time (almost always when the verb precedes another, which IS conjugated).

| Voice   | Active | Passive | Active | Passive |
| :---:   |:-----: | :----: | :----:  | :----:  |
| Tense   | Simple | Simple | Contd.  | Contd.  |
| Past    | -an    | -ans   | -ant    | -anst   |
| Present | -t     | -(e)st | -(e)jt  | -(e)jst |
| Future  | -ar    | -ars   | -art    | -arst   |

**Exception: sej ('be')**

| Voice   | Active | Passive | Active | Passive |
| :---:   |:-----: | :----: | :----:  | :----:  |
| Tense   | Simple | Simple | Contd.  | Contd.  |
| Past    | sein   | seins  | seint   | seinst  |
| Present | sej    | sejs   | sejt    | sejst   |
| Future  | sar    | sars   | sart    | sarst   |

## Pronouns

### Personal

|     | Nom. | Det. |
|:-:  |:--:  |:--:  |
| 1s  | Je   | Jen  |
| 1p  | Na   | Nes  |
| 2s  | Du   | Dun  |
| 2p  | Ve   | Ves  |
| 3s  | Sa   | San  |
| 3p  | He   | Hes  |
| 3sp | In   | Ine  |

A unique feature of Ijter is the possibility of combining a personal pronoun with a definite or indefinite determiner.

| Phrase        | English                      | Lit. translation  |
|:---           |:---                          |:---               |
| jenen besätim | a colleague of mine          | my-a(n) colleague |
| saner fränden | those friends of theirs (sg) | their-the friends |

## Grammar

The order of different word classes is as follows:  
- (Determiner) (\[1] Nature) (Noun) (Adjective)
- (Subject) (Verb) (Object)
- (Verb) (Adverb) (*Place) (*Time)

\[1] : applies to demonyms and few other cases, such as when two nouns would normally be aggutinated

e.g. "I want to know why you wouldn't meet with me yesterday"
would be "I want.PR know why-NOM you NEG would.PST meet (at)yesterday with me"

e.g "You should give me another chance"
would be "You should give chance another to me"

Note that this is subject to some variation.

When a phrase contains a catenative verb in addition to a regular verb, the former is conjugated while the latter remains in its infinitive/root/unconjugated form.
