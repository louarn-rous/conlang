`2022/12/29 [from #announcements]` it's funny that consonants ended up being pretty international even if my intention was never to make an auxlang
and before you say /h/ isn't international, i had to learn to pronounce it as a completely new sound so..
it becomes v. clear that it's not international when you look at the vocab, the vast majority of which is taken from either english, french, german or a mix between them. i'm also aware that the very large number of consonants is the opposite of international, although i'll likely get rid of /ə/ (which i planned to do multiple times) and certainly /ɑ/ since i never planned for it to be there
also /ɔ/ has been a part of the vowels but rarely implemented so i might include it only as a digraph
not a digraph but like a rule, like 'or' becomes [ɔʁ] instead of [oʁ]
keeping in mind that most words are taken from en, fr or de, if you have any ideas for words or such pls dm me :3
other stuff im aiming towards: inclusive and exclusive 'we', minimal conjugation of verbs according to pronouns, general regularity

`2022/12/30 [from #announcements]` oh also i make sorta start making a 2nd conlang, which would essentially be a sort of very dense informational medium which uses pictograms to represent certain concepts
i heard the term 'engineering language' in reference to that kind of thing but when i tried searching for it all that came up was stuff on programming languages that are good in the field of engineering, rather than... anything related to conlanging
also i started writing a piece on how english could be made to be more consistent and efficient, i don't think i'll make a conlang (con-dialect?) out of it though, i'll probably expand upon it maybe a little and then type it up so i can make it into a blog
i should actually start doing that, i've got a bunch of stuff i've written down and done nothing with when  they might be good if i could put them up on my page
i have a lot of personal projects atm, hopefully ill remember to show you guys more of them and more often here

`2023/01/18` looking at pronouns (inc. possessives) and articles, comparative and superlative for adjectives
pissed cause so many nasalized sounds in french that feel natural to me but i can't include
also ive noticed that /ə/ is a good sound but i personally have difficulty differentiating it with /œ/
which came up while i was still deciding phonemes, i decided to go with /œ/ but it was only over slight preference
if i got rid of /œ/ in favour of /ə/ i would probably also get rid of /ø/ (also ive yet to use /œ/ in ANY vocab so unless i find a good use without shoving it in just for the sake of using it, i might leave it behind) in order to have a smaller vowel inventory

`2023/02/16` had a great idea of using flesh as both a noun and a verb meaning 'to give shape/form to', like how we say 'fleshed out' in english

`2023/02/28` what if i just. didnt have possessives and instead just put the object after the subject

`2023/02/31` [...] da - it's [...] (asserting statement)

`05-03-2023` although im tempted to also make '-ér' and '-ést' suffixes for adj.s since as i said in #project-discussion, too much modularism is ugg

`2023/03/06` ok so back to alphabet for once
many languages use ö for /ø/, a lot of them (Asturian in Iberia, Chenchen, Estonian, German and some of its dialects, Lombard, Luxembourgish, Sater Frisian among others)
its nice to have ø represent itself but of course thats not a rule ive ever considered, otherwise /e/ wouldnt be é
i feel like ø looks to distinctly scandinavian, which is bad considering my language has very minor scandinavian influence
because yes, aesthetics is important when considering alphabet
ö is used by a bunch of germanic languages, which have arguably the most influence on my conlang (remember, english is a germanic language, im also often borrow from german and dutch) so it makes sense i would use it
i think more of the examples of /ø/ on wikipedia use ö compared to ø
the `o ö` pair would also go nicely with `é è`

`2023-03-06`
since im feeling theres strong meaningful difference between obj & subj case for 1st person, im gonna assign `Iž` as temporary subject 'I'

`2023/03/07` in a couple cases im conflicted between roman and latin roots
for example, idk if 'god' should be 'Got' or 'Dös'/'Döš'

07-03-2023
```draft

fil - filo
ord - ordo
fob - fobo
lyd - lydo```

`2023/03/10` what if i used `ü` instead of`y`? it would allow me to forego the use of `y` entirely (because broken keyboard + `y` looks completely different to `u` even though they are 'twinned' in my alphabet due to vague phonetic proximity\) plus multiple languages use it to represent /y/ while `u` represents... /u/

`2023/03/10` saw something i'd written down before: i should have a particle to demonstrate when a verb is reflexive or intransitive (which are different)

`2023/03/10` steering things in a diff. direction: i'm not giving up, i will still have a non-roman script

`2023/03/10` since im very interested by concepts surrounding input, language and codes, i'm gonna see if i can come up with a sort of highly efficient keyboard-type thing which isnt in traditional layout/structure

`2023-03-12`
tz → ts, dz   ·   pz → ps, bz   ·   kz → ks, gz
tž → tš, dž   ·   pž → pš, bž   ·   kž → kš, gž
ds → dz, ts   ·   bs → bz, ps   ·   gs → gz, ks
dš → dž, tš   ·   bš → bž, pš   ·   gš → gž, kš

sd → st, zd   ·   sb → sp, zb   ·   sg → sk, zg
šd → št, žd   ·   šb → šp, žb   ·   šg → šk, žg
zt → zd, st   ·   zp → zb, sp   ·   zk → zg, sk
žt → žd, št   ·   žp → žb, šp   ·   žk → žg, šk

this is to map out 'permitted' consonants
because /k/¸ /s/, /ʃ/, /t/ are unrounded while /g/, /z/, /ʒ/, /d/ are rounded
pronouncing rounded and unrounded syllables in succession is hard and makes an unclear sound
if you try to pronounce /kz/ it'll sound like /gz/ or /ks/

`13-03-2023` pissed cause (the above means that) 'us'/'we' is a homophone of 'no' and 'our' is a homophone of '9'
homophones are natural, even with really common words, but i tend to avoid them as much as possible
albeit idk if they would really conflict enough for this to be a problem

`2023/03/17` what is better: 'got' (germanic, e.g: "god" in english, "gott" in german) or 'dös' (latin, e.g: "dieu" in french, "dio" in italian, "deus" in portugese)
...please give me feedback i need to make progress

based on mostly serbian and some russian cyrillic

`2023/03/17` for def. det. i could do `ér`, like how breton does 'ar' and but it keeps the same vowel as `én`

`2023/03/19`
this would mean perfect symetry
o : rounded close-mid back vowel   - o

u : rounded close back vowel          - u
y : rounded close front vowel          - ü

thinking about /ə/ again...
theres too many foreign place names that i dont want to butcher
im aiming to keep country names close to original

thats an idea ive had since 21st of Feb

this is in no way mandatory, though i appreciate any and all effort at participation

`2023/03/23`
realized that `an` is way too awkward as indef. det.
its just annoying to make, i think its because of how /a/ is made
and i thought for a while, 'what should i do'
i considered `ön` and `d'ön` for 'of the'
but something i just remembered, i used to employ `én` for verb 'have' and then retracted it
its pretty good as an intermediate, easier to pronounce

`2023/03/24` i want to slowly move towards making proper 'dictionary' definitions in english instead of just listing the english equivalent for each word with occasional additional context, but its a lot of work, especially for shit like this which is really hard to describe from the ground up
i already started doing that a little bit with that finalized document, although idk if ill keep going
like im not a fucking dictionary writer, thats an enormous amount of work even for a very limited vocab
if im to develop it sufficiently, it would be way too much to have to write an entire dictionary with descriptions that are actual definitions instead of english translations (which i've been doing in my github documents)

`2023/03/24`
-1:day i þought ðat 'is' & 'us' could b good 4 proximal & distal det.s (respectively) 'this' and 'that' & ðeir corresponding nouns ('here' and 'there')
'i went there' → 'iž irèt us'
'you want this shoe' → 'tö vyr is šos'
'he needs to play here' → 'sö baž lyd is'
'they worked in that school' → 'zö tröbèt im us skol'
...
`us;n.:in a place or location distal from the speaker;prn. dem.:that which is indicated or understood from context, esp. in contrast to a (more proximate) thing`
`is;n. in a place or location proximate to the speaker;prn. dem.:which is indicated or understood from context`
these are bad descriptions, feel free to suggest better wording/improvement

`2023/03/30` had an idea, its still useful to have gener prns so i could do
1ps fem. : sa - san
1ps masc. : so - son
(despite their simplicity these dont overlap with any preexisting words)

`2023/04/01` most of these i just list as their english equivalent but when i feel like it, i put a dictionary definition (usually close correspondence to wikitionary article, although there's a few i did some weeks ago, then i used an oxford australian english dictionary)

similarly:
- to smell ≠ to smell of

`2023/04/20` got a really stupid idea last night
i could allow combining indef/def det. with a personal det. to indicate that the subject is simultaneously either (def/indef) and belonging to a person
'ér *friend*' → 'the *friend*'
'mön *friend*' → 'my *friend*'
- 'mönér *friend*' → 'that *friend* of mine'
'én *colleague*' → 'a *colleague*'
'tön *colleague*' → 'your *colleague*'
- 'tönén *colleague*' → 'a *colleague* of yours'
honestly i have no goddamn clue if this even exists in any language, even any constructed one

i wanted to keep the alphabet to 26 letters for esoteric reasons but actually i realised that i dont care
which is why im now considering adding 
Cc Ћћ · /tʃ/
Čč Ђђ · /dʒ/
since those sounds are oft present
cyrillic forms are from the serbian cyrillic alphabet so im slowly making my language more serbian :flag_rs: /j

`2023/05/01` heres something, not perfect but it's a start
sorry if theres a few reliant on specific dialects of english (and one on german), nonspecific english actually doesnt contain a lot of vowels that other languages/certain dialects do

im so stupid i couldve written these in text instead of spending ages adjusting it for the longer lines

`2023-05-01` i had decided to use 'éd' for 'eat' but it feels too weird and too identical to the CV-structure e-syllable verbs i tend to have, which are meant for important things like 'to be' or 'to have'   /   something more latin like 'manž' (italian 'mangiare', french 'manger') might be more natural

`02-05-2023`
had an epiphany on the bus
```because =!= despite
therefore =!= nevertheless```i dont know how to describe it but theyre like a sort of grid
A because B == B therefore A
A despite B == B nevertheless A
before i was trying to brainstorm all the words like these and i wasnt finding any pattern to it and i wondered if i could ever know for sure id covered everything
now i know that for these 4 and their synonyms, theres a symetry

`2023-05-13` will probably move #conlang-archive to an offline doc

`2023-05-15` i need to redo verb conjugation suffixes

`2023-05-15` unrelated, might change /v/ to /ʋ/ ("roughly between **v**ortex and **w**ar " according to wikipedia)
i dont think i should be afraid of messing around with phonology, even now
yeah it sucks to idle on a single feature but thats not the same as making revisions

`2023-05-16` will probably delete #ijter-media since i rarely translate stuff, all the things i do are saved on my pc, and they can just be posted here

`2023-05-16` i tried installing PolyGlot at home but im not sure it even did because i set it up from a .deb file and i can't find it within the d-menu, and afaik no application has been created anywhere

`2023-05-16` this might seem radical but i *could* remove è /ɛ/ entirely
/e/ is already an extremely common vowel, making the difference between the two is not something that most languages do, in the sense that most languages don't have /ɛ/ at all
>> this would also mean that typing 'é' or 'è' wouldnt be necessary since removing /ɛ/ would mean that /e/ would be changed to 'e'
>> also the cyrillic form Э/э would be removed, which is preferrable since it looks similar to З/з (although i wish it was the latter that could be removed, since it looks nearly identical to the number 3)

`2023-05-19` installed polyglot and poking around, pretty good so far

`2023-05-23` consonant diagraphs wherein the succeeding letter is v will probably become labialized forms of the preceding consonant, if possible
ie 'kv' → /kʷ/ and 'gv' → /gʷ/
for those of you who dont even IPA, yes those are pronounced pretty much like what you think   /   gwa gwa

`2023-05-23`
solution to the 'give birth'/'be born' problem is to make distinction between active and passive in verb conjugation
will definitely do by the use of affixes, i'd usually go with a change of suffix but i could do prefix as well
ive been thinking of having a- as an adjective → verb prefix, similar to how french does it 
e.g: "arrondir" which means "to make round" : __a__(r)rond [rond = circle] -ir

`2023-05-23` i think that i should use the ending particle 'da' not as an affirmative 'is', 
wherein for example "blo da" = "[it] is blue"
but rather as an interrogative marker where "blo da" = "(is it) blue?"
english has particular cases where verbs are placed at the start of a sentence to mark interrogation, such as 'are you' or 'do you'. french does something similar except with much more broader use, 'est-ce que' being used to mark the following clause as part of a yes/no question, e.g: 'est-ce que tu aimes la soupe' being '(do) you like soup'
i guess english still uses it pretty flexibly, like "is it" but it would be "is it green" whereas french would have "est-ce que c'est vert" which contains the fragment "c'est vert" meaning "it is green" which does not occur in english since "it green" is malformed
so french use of "est-ce que <statement>" is a bit better since <statement> by itself is well-formed (and responding to the question with the contained statement makes sense, and affirms a positive answer)

`2023-05-23`

//
“Iž baesi en kleb" → I bit a dog
"Iž baesi na en kleb" → I was bitten by a dog
"Er kleb baesi mö" → The dog bit me
"Er kleb baesi na mö" → The dog was bitten by me

doubled consonants will, in most cases, be geminated or otherwise reduced (to a single consonant)

(legi- and liter- are certainly different roots but im grouping them cause their meaning are related somewhat)
funny, comes from Latin 'lego' which i used to derive 'läg' (select, choose)
…and 'libr-' comes from 'liber', which the romans decided was a great idea to use to signify both 'book' and 'free'
and which i already used to derive the latter.
that means 'littera' (letter) is the only remaining option. i can't not also use it for 'letter' so ill have to find a way to derive 'book' from it as well. should be interesting
